## License

No license is needed for SDK evaluation - it will work in demo mode (with some restrictions).

**MisbCore SDK** is a node-locked software, so you have to get a license (**after purchasing the SDK**) in order to lift demo restrictions. Please install it and fill out an [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_XW6bDsFce1G1cpds4gMQNlwNax0CvkWzcMbscxZ5rLaIbA/viewform), providing the ***Node Info*** string (IMPORTANT!!!) for the target machine.  
***Node Info*** string can be seen when you run the demo app, as shown below.

If your computer is offline or you're unable to copy the Node Info text, take a photo of the window with the QR code clearly visible and send it to us instead.

You'll receive a license file and a key that can be utilized in the Activate method.

> For large quantities, please contact us for an **unlocked license**.
